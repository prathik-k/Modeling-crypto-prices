Code for the project "Modeling stock prices with Brownian motion".

### The structure of the root directory is:

In the current setup, the important file to run is "main.py". We intend to accept command line arguments for main.py in the final version, but have not included this for the midterm report. Please refer to the instructions in the main.py file to execute the code, and the files labelled "GBM_base.py" and "cryptocurrency.py" under the classes directory for a description of class member functions.
